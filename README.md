# rbac-client

A Clojure library designed to hold lightweight API clients for PE services.

## Usage

The clients are meant to provide alternate versions of the TK services.
You should be able to merely include them in the bootstrap.

### Configuration

The clients use ssl authorization via the global.certs keys.

- `global.certs.ssl-key`: the key for this clients identity.
- `global.certs.ssl-cert`: the cert for this clients identity.
- `global.certs.ssl-ca-cert`: the ca-cert for this clients cert and the upstream service.

Authenticated and unauthenticated clients have different connection limits via the
rbac-consumer or activity-consumer settings.

- `rbac-consumer.max-connections-total-auth`: total connection limit for authenticated client
- `rbac-consumer.max-connections-per-route-auth`: connection limit per route for authenticated client
- `rbac-consumer.max-connections-total-unauth`: total connection limit for unauthenticated client
- `rbac-consumer.max-connections-per-route-unauth`: connection limit per route for unauthenticated client

The location of the RBAC and Activity services are configured with the
`rbac-consumer.api-url` and `activity-consumer.api.url` settings respectivetly.

### Activity

The Activity service protocol should be considered temporary and unstable. It may not
directly match the Activity Reporting service protocol, which may itself be unstable.

## Testing

The tests require pki files in the `dev-resources/ssl/` directory of:
  * `ca.pem`: a CA cert with the CN of "puppet"
  * `key.pem`: a node private key
  * `cert.pem`: a cert signed by `ca.pem` for the private key at `key.pem` with a CN of "localhost"
  * `alternate-ca.pem`: a valid but untrusted CA cert

The repo contains these files needed for testing, though if needed you may
want to read `dev-resources/gen-pki.sh` for the commands to generate additional
sets of files.
